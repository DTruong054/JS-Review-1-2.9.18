<!-- Create three parallel arrays. One which holds the names of a total of 10 employees. One which holds the number of hours each
employee worked in a given week. The last array should hold the dollar amounts for the salaries (dollar per hour) of the
employees. 

Build a for loop which calculates the pay for each of the employees for the week. Your output should produce 1
employee per line, stating “Employee _ _ _ name _ _ _ worked _ _ _ hours during the previous week, for a total of _ _ _ dollars
at _ _ _ dollars per hour.” -->
